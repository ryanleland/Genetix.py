Genetix.py is a project designed to make genetic algorithms in python as easy as possible. You can run demo.py for an example of how you could use a genetic algorithm, and StringTarget.py for an example of how to create a target class.

For a quick lesson on what genetic algorithms are and how you can use them, please see the tutorial at <http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html>.
